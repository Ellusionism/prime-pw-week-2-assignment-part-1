    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Are there any advantages to using the single/double quotes ('/") over the apostrophe (`)? So far it seems to me the only difference is that ${var} can be inserted directly into a sentence with the apostrophe, but not with  quotes.</p>
    <p>Similarly, are there any advantages to using 2x = over 3x =? as far as I can tell === does everything == can and more.</p>
